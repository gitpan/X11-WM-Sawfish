=head1 NAME

X11::WM::Sawfish::UNIX - Perl extension for sending LISP forms to the sawfish window manager over UNIX domain sockets.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use X11::WM::Sawfish::UNIX;

  my $x = new X11::WM::Sawfish::UNIX($display);

  $x->eval_form('(display-message "Foo")');

=head1 ABSTRACT

X11::WM::Sawfish::UNIX implements the communication protocol used to connect to
a running instance of the Sawfish window manager with UNIX domain sockets.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Sawfish window manager supports two schemes for submitting LISP forms
for evaluation.  This module implements the UNIX domain sockets scheme.

To use X11::WM::Sawfish::UNIX, simply create an instance the same way as with
L<X11::WM::Sawfish>, and use it the same way.  The methods available are the
same as well.
