X11/WM/Sawfish version 0.01
===========================

This module implements the two methods for remotely evaluating LISP forms in
the Sawfish window manager for X11.  X11::WM::Sawfish::UNIX implements the UNIX
domain sockets method, and X11::WM::Sawfish::XProp implements the X server
window properties method.  Both are derived from X11::WM::Sawfish, and the new
method of the base class creates one of the two derived classes depending on
which it can create.  The UNIX domain socket method is attempted first, with
the X properties method the fallback.
